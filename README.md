# STAKING CONTRACT EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION

Replicated staking contract as per logic of [smartcontract engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32n3Vu0BK4g)

1. Users stake 0KAGE tokens and get rKAGE tokens (both ERC20)
2. Total of 10 million rKAGE tokens would be issued as rewards over 12 months
3. On unstaking, users get back their 0KAGE tokens and proportionate rKAGE tokens, as per their ownership in pool
4. Rewards are calculated every second
